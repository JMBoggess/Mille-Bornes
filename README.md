# Mille Bornes and Machine Learning
[Mille Bornes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_Bornes) is a card game created in 1954 by Edmond Dujardin. I have enjoyed playing this game from the time I was a boy to now with my children. I wanted a project I could use to explore Reinforcement Learning - a machine learning training technique. This repository serves as the collection point for all the code and discoveries I have made along the way.
